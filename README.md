# Email Automation ⚡️

## Goal for this project

The main objective behind my project is to automate the boring and repetitive task of sending emails.

With an ever-growing demand to communicate with our peers and colleagues in the institute or at jobs, we constantly have to write our emails manually which takes a significant amount of our time.

Even in the times of a global pandemic, the world had to adapt to remote working which drastically increased the need to send emails.

As we can imagine, Python is the ideal companion to send any kind of email automatically with or without our supervision.
By using Python, we can automate the process of sending emails. It’s especially handy when we have to send similar content over and over again. This automation can reduce human errors and free our time as well!
